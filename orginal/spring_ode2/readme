 SPRING_ODE2 is a C++ program which shows how Gnuplot graphics can be used to illustrate a solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes the motion of a weight attached to a spring.

This program is a revision of the SPRING_ODE program. A second change that we make is that we use vectors (C arrays) to store the data.

Hooke's law for a spring observes that the restoring force is proportional to the displacement:

        F = - k x
      

and Newton's law relates the force to acceleration:

        F = m a
      

Putting these equations together, we have:

        m * d^2 x/dt^2 = - k * x
      

We can add a damping force with coefficient c:

        m * d^2 x/dt^2 = - k * x - c * dx/dt
      

If we write this as a pair of first order equations for (x,v), we have

            dx/dt = v
        m * dv/dt = - k * x - c * v
      

and now we can approximate these values for small time steps.
